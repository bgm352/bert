BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
Show Image
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art pre-trained language representation model developed by Google Research. BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers, allowing it to excel in a wide range of NLP tasks.
Features

Pre-trained BERT models with different configurations
Fine-tuning capabilities for various downstream NLP tasks
Support for sequence classification, token classification, and question answering
Efficient implementation with PyTorch
Easy integration with existing NLP pipelines

Installation
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bgm352/bert.git
cd bert

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Loading a Pre-trained Model
pythonfrom bert import BertModel, BertTokenizer

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize input
text = "Here is some text to encode"
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')

# Forward pass
outputs = model(**encoded_input)
Fine-tuning for Classification
pythonfrom bert import BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Load model for sequence classification
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)

# Prepare your dataset and dataloaders

# Training loop example
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

for epoch in range(3):
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(**batch)
        loss = outputs.loss
        
        # Backward pass
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
